# ISLR
Python written exercises of 'Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R' by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani (2013). The link to the book is here:

where you can find lab codes, datasets and figures. However all the codes are in R. It would be a good practise to do excercises in Python.
